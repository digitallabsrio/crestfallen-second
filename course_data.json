  "course_name": "Cracking the Google Associate Cloud Engineer Certification - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "Google Cloud Platform will be the next major cloud admin skill in the coming years. Google is increasing its market reach in the cloud provider domain using strategic partnerships and a lot of funding for the customers. So, no doubt that GCP is going to dominate the cloud domain in the coming years.\n\nThis course is a headstart to quickly get hands-on with GCP and make yourself comfortable with it. You will start with \"Why GCP?\" and will go all the way to using its services in different ways. If you are from an AWS background, you will find the course very easy to understand due to similarities between AWS and GCP services.\n\nAt the end of the course, you will take a practice exam that will resemble the exam youâ€™ll take when you go to get your Google Cloud Engineer Certification. Good luck!",
